👋🏽 Hi, I am Amaefule Uchechukwu Stephen  
Pharmacist | Pharmaceutical Data Science | AI for Drug Therapy

🎓 B.Pharm (First Class, GPA 4.8/5), Madonna University, Nigeria  
💡 I build interpretable ML and data pipelines that support safer, more precise drug therapy in real clinical contexts.

---

### Research and Technical Interests

- **Pharmaceutical Data Science**  
  Modeling dose response, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships, therapeutic outcomes, and safety signals from clinical data.

- **Pharmacogenomics (PGx)**  
  Using genotype and clinical covariates to predict optimal dosing, reduce toxicity, and understand variability in drug response.

- **AI in Therapeutics and Clinical Decision Support**  
  Interpretable models for precision dosing, toxicity risk stratification, and decision support tools that clinicians can realistically trust and use.

- **Bioinformatics and Multi-omics**  
  RNA-seq and variant data analysis to uncover mechanisms that link molecular profiles to drug response and treatment outcomes.

---

### Core Skills

- **Programming and Data**  
  Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Jupyter, Streamlit  
  Data cleaning, feature engineering, cross-validation, model selection, and evaluation.

- **Bioinformatics and PGx**  
  Biopython, FASTA and VCF handling  
  RNA-seq analysis workflows, differential expression, pathway-level summaries.

- **ML and MLOps Practices**  
  End-to-end modeling pipelines  
  Model calibration and basic error analysis  
  Reproducible environments (virtualenv, pinned `requirements.txt`)  
  CI with GitHub Actions, tagged releases, and versioned experiments.

- **Good Research Practice**  
  Clear documentation, model and data cards  
  Strong focus on interpretability, clinical plausibility, and reproducibility, not only on performance metrics.

### Selected Projects (Pharm Sci and AI/ML Focus)

- **[PGx Warfarin ML Portfolio](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/pgx-warfarin-ml-portfolio)**  
  End-to-end pharmacogenomic dosing pipeline built on IWPC-style data. Covers ETL, feature engineering for clinical and genetic covariates, multiple ML baselines, and SHAP-based interpretability to understand how variants and patient factors shift dose recommendations.  
  *Stack: Python, scikit-learn, SHAP, Streamlit*

- **[Gentamicin PK and ML Dosing Model](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/gentamicin-pk-ml)**  
  Hybrid pharmacokinetic and machine learning workflow that uses patient covariates and PK principles to classify therapeutic versus non-therapeutic concentrations and support initial dosing decisions. Shows how ML can complement classical dosing nomograms in antimicrobial therapy using a one-compartment gentamicin model and a RandomForest classifier.  
  *Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit*

- **[RNA-seq Differential Expression for Drug Response Biology](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/rnaseq_differential_expression)**  
  RNA-seq workflow from QC through differential expression and volcano plots, designed to explore how gene expression programs may relate to treatment effects and toxicity. Supports GEO downloads and local supplementary tables, with clear outputs and figures.  
  *Stack: Python, GEOparse, matplotlib*

- **[Gene Expression Classifier for Disease States](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/gene-expression-classifier)**  
  Supervised learning on gene expression matrices, with calibrated probabilities and basic error analysis, showing how omics signals can be incorporated into therapeutic decision support and patient stratification.  
  *Stack: Python, scikit-learn*

- **[Diabetes Clinical ML Portfolio](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/diabetes-ml-portfolio)**  
  Clinical tabular data project focusing on risk prediction and stratification in diabetes. Emphasizes feature importance, fair evaluation, and how such models might integrate into medication review, follow-up planning, and identification of high-risk patients.  
  *Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas*

- **[DNA Sequence Explorer](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/dna-sequence-explorer)**  
  Command-line tool for GC content, codon usage, and motif scans, with tests and a clean interface. Intended as a reusable component for pharmacogenomic and regulatory variant exploration.  
  *Stack: Python, Biopython*

- **Other Utilities**  
  - **[Data Dashboard](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/data_dashboard)**  
    Lightweight analytics dashboard built with Streamlit, pandas, and Plotly to explore and visualize tabular clinical or omics data.  
  - **[Automated File Organizer](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/automated_file_organizer)**  
    Utility script that automatically sorts files into labeled folders, with dry-run and undo support and a clean CLI.

📁 Each repository is structured with a reproducible environment and example outputs or figures.

### Documentation and Research Philosophy

I aim for readable code, transparent data handling, and fully reproducible workflows so that pharmaceutical science results can be trusted, reused, and extended by others.

---

### Background

- Licensed Pharmacist, Pharmacy Council of Nigeria  
- Internship, Planning Research and Statistics Department, Pharmacy Council of Nigeria  
- Current role: Bioinformatics and Computational Pharmacy, Genomac Inc  
- Training: Harvard CS50, 100 Days of Python, Genomac Bioinformatics Bootcamp  

This combination of clinical pharmacy training and computational practice shapes how I design models and interpret results.

### Academic and Research Goals

I am pursuing MSc Pharmaceutical Sciences with a focus on AI and Machine Learning.

I want to work on:

- AI-driven pharmacogenomic and clinical models for dose optimization and toxicity reduction  
- Integration of multi-omics and clinical data for decision support in therapeutics  
- Interpretable ML systems that clinicians can trust when adjusting therapy, especially for under-represented populations and data-sparse settings  

I am particularly interested in supervisors who work at the interface of pharmacology, pharmacometrics or PK/PD, data science, and clinical decision support, with a focus on improving real-world therapeutic outcomes.
